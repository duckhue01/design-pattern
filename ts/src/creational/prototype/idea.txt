intent:
  prototype is creational design pattern that lets you copy existing object without making
  your code dependent on their classes



applicability:
  use prototype pattern when you want your code don't depend on the concrete classes of objects
  that your need to copy

  clone private filed

pros:
  you can clone objects without  coupling to their concrete classes

  you can produce complex object more conveniently

cons:
  cloning complex objects that that have circular references might be very tricky
