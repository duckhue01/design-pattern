intent:



applicability:
  use the command pattern when you want to parametrize object with operations

  use the command pattern when you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or
  execute them 
  
  use the command pattern when you want to implement reversible operations

pros: 
  single responsibility principle

  open/close principle 

  you can implement undo/redo

  you can implement deferred execution of operations

  you can assemble a set of simple command into a complex one

cons:
  the code may become more complicated sine you're introducing a whole new layer between senders
  and receivers
