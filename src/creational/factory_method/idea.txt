intent:
  factory method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for 
  creating object in super class. but allow the sub class alter the type of object
  will be created

applicability:
  use when we don't know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the object
  your code should work with (easy to introduce new product)
  -> factory method use separate class for creating a product so that when we add new
  product to the app it don't effect to the rest of the code
  
  use when you want your customer have ability to extend internal components

  use when you want the system save resource instead of create new object each time

cons: 
  single responsibility principle
  open/closed principle
  voiding tight coupling between creator and concrete product
pos:
  code may becoming more complicated because you have to introduce a lot of factory class
