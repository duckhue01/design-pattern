intent:
  builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step
  the pattern allow you produce difference type and representation of an object using the same
  constructor code

applicability:
  use the builder pattern to get rid of a ugly constructor
  
  use builder pattern when you want your code to be able to create different representation of 
  some product

  Use the Builder to construct Composite trees or other complex objects.

cons:
  you can create object step by step
  
  you can reuse the same constructor code when building various representation of products
  
  single responsibility principle
pros:

  the overall complexity  of the code increases since the pattern require creating multiple 
  new classes
