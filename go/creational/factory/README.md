### Factory method -delegating the creation of different types of payments
    the factory pattern is probably the second-best known and used design pattern in the industry. Its purpose is to abstract the user from the knowledge of the structure he needs to achieve for a specific purpose, such as retrieving some value, maybe from a web service or a database. The user only needs an interface that provide an interface that fits the user needs. It also eases the process of downgrading or upgrading of the implementation of the underlying type if needed


#### Objective
1. delegating the creation of new instances of structures to a different part of the program
2. working at the interface level instead of with concrete implementations
3. grouping families of objects to obtain a family object creator
